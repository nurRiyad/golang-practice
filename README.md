# Golang Practice

I started learning Go last week. My country (Bangladesh) experienced a total internet blackout for five days, and the only programming tutorial I had saved on my device was for Go. So that's why I started learning Go. This GitHub repository contains all the Go code that I practiced while learning from the tutorials.
